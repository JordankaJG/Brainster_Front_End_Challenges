# Challenge_6

The uploaded Challenges Folders are part from the Homework program in Brainster Accademy and they where alredy git finished.

The files are written in HTML and CSS.

To Add the folders on GitLab repository I was using the folowing steps:

* I had already crated remote repo on gitlab with the name BrainsterChallenges_Jordanka_GjeorgievaFE13.

* On my PC I have created separate folders for each Challenge where I cloned the remote repo with the branch main.

* From main branch I have created new branch with the challenge name using the command "git branch-b (name)",starter files where added and commited the action.

* Used "git push -u origin (name)"  to push the changes on the remote branch and finishing the task I was given.
