5. Bootstrap
6. UX/UI
7. JavaScript

It starts with using  a code efficiently on the Visual Studio Code environment: HTML syntax, elements and variables, semantical HTML5 tags. Working with tables, lists, forms, iframes and media in building a static websites.
Next,I have  visually organized HTML sites with the help of CSS using the box and flexbox models, CSS media queries in building responsive websites - selectors, positioning, transitions, and animations.Also,I have  used basic and advanced concepts of Sass and using nesting, mixins, placeholders, and functions to write more expressive and reusable styles, as well as compiling Sass code and variables.Also, I designed responsive and browser/device compatible landing pages using Bootstrap 5, Bootstrap 5 Grid system, libraries and utility classes and components - typography, carousels, panels, cards, progress bars, drop-down menus, modals and tool tips.

It continues with using Git, I created local repositories and executing basic and advanced Git operations, terminals, file systems, versioning, merges, pull resquests, cloning repos, commits, collaborations.

From Challenge_09 onwards I use  Java Script,jQuery & Ajax,TypeScript,ReactJS,NextJS.
I was using types of data, control structures, concept of DOM structure and DOM elements, creating interactions with the help of events, functions and various methods for string manipulation, synchronous and asynchronous programming, and finally, object-oriented programming and advanced concepts of ES6+.

There is successfully working with selectors and attributes, DOM Traversing and DOM manipulation, animation and effects, jQuery methods for AJAX (load(), get(), post()) and other plugins for enhancing jQuery functionality.

With React I was building components and user interfaces with Typescript, basic React.js concepts, such as JSX, state and props, as well as advanced such as React Router, Higher order Components, Context API, useMemo, useCallback, CSS animations and transitions, debugging.
